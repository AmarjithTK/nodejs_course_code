### Model view controller

here I am studying using the model view controller architecture to make shop app more modular and easy to read


Folder hierarchy

    main
        controllers - ( similar to named routes in --> flutter )
        models - productModel ( similar to quizbrain --> class Question(string q,string a) in dart )
        views - all the ejs ( no pug , I love the ejs ablity to embed js)
        data - no database , so broke ( maybe mongoose or firebase next time)
        routes - need to find better name ( admin,shope --> .js)
